HOW QT5 IS USED:
----------------
1. Application Structure: QApplication manages main event loop and system integration
2. Window Management: QMainWindow provides menu bar, status bar, and central widget area
3. Layout System: Automatic widget sizing and positioning using layout managers
4. Event Handling: Mouse clicks, keyboard input, and timer events processed through Qt event system
5. Threading: QThread ensures GUI remains responsive during file scanning operations
6. Styling: CSS-like styling system for custom appearance and color schemes
7. Internationalization: Built-in support for multiple languages and locales
8. Resource Management: Automatic memory management and parent-child widget relationships

ALTERNATIVE FRONTEND TECHNOLOGIES:
