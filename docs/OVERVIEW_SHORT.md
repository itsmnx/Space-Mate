SpaceMate is a compact, offline disk management tool written in modern C++ (C++17) with a Qt5-based GUI and a scriptable CLI. The project is built with CMake and separates concerns across modules: CLI entry (`main.cpp`), core functionality in `core/`, public interfaces in `include/`, and GUI code in `gui/`. It relies on standard system and POSIX calls (e.g., `stat`, `opendir`), `std::filesystem` for portability, and optionally OpenSSL or Qt's `QCryptographicHash` for hashing. The build produces two executables: `spacemate_cli` for headless use and `SpacemateGUI` for interactive use, and it runs comfortably on Linux and WSL2 with an X11 server (VcXsrv) for GUI display on Windows.

Files are organized to keep implementation and interfaces clear: header files in `include/` declare the public APIs for `DiskMonitor`, `FileAnalyzer`, `CleanupManager`, and `BackupManager`; concrete logic lives in `core/*.cpp`; and GUI glue (widgets, layouts, signals/slots) is in `gui/` with `mainwindow.cpp` orchestrating views. The `main.cpp` for the CLI instantiates the core managers and invokes their high-level operations (scan, analyze, clean, restore), while the GUI constructs UI components that call the same underlying core logic, often via wrapper methods or queued signals to keep the UI responsive. Backup and logging components centralize state: backups are written to a dedicated directory and indexed so the cleanup engine can verify backups before removal and allow safe restores later.

The GUI is implemented with Qt5 widgets using a tabbed layout (Dashboard, Analyze, Cleanup, Backup, Activity Log). The Dashboard queries `QStorageInfo` / `statvfs()` to render a segmented storage visualization and displays monitoring statistics; the Analyze tab runs recursive scans and populates categorized results (duplicates, temp files, old files); the Cleanup tab presents duplicates in a table allowing selective deletion with automatic backup; the Backup tab lists backup entries and supports restore operations. To maintain responsiveness, long-running tasks are run in worker threads or background tasks and update the UI via signals/slots; progress and activity messages are written to the Activity Log in real time and timestamps use a 24-hour format for clarity.

SpaceMate's aims are pragmatic: give users clear, actionable visibility into disk usage; find and safely remove redundant or transient data; automate safe backups before destructive operations; and remain privacy-preserving by operating entirely offline. It targets common pain points—duplicate waste, forgotten temp files, old large files—while placing user control first through preview/dry-run options, confirmations, and a backup/restore flow. The project is intentionally modular so the CLI can be scripted for automation while the GUI supports interactive exploration, making SpaceMate suitable for both end-users and system administrators.

Compared with generic OS utilities (like `du`, `df`, or ad-hoc `find`/`rm` pipelines) and heavier commercial cleaners, SpaceMate balances accuracy, safety, and usability. It uses hash-based duplicate detection (MD5/SHA variants) combined with size-first filtering for speed, which is more reliable than name-only or size-only heuristics. Its automatic backup-before-delete policy and indexable restore capability make cleanup safer than raw `rm` usage. Because it leverages native system calls and avoids cloud dependencies, it remains lightweight and fast on local machines; its modular architecture reduces unnecessary overhead compared to some monolithic GUI cleaners and gives predictable performance and memory usage on the scales typical for personal and small-server workloads.
